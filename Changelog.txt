All notable changes to the IYS2022_Shimada_NW_Zooplankton.xlsx or '7-14 2022 Bongo Logbook-TINRO_clean.xlsx will be documented in this file.
These are the two original input files for the standardized 2022 Bongo data record.

## Notes:

The files '2022002 IYS Franklin abund biomass by species n life stage .xlsx' and '7-14 2022 Bongo Logbook-TINRO_clean.xlsx' -- stored in /original_data/archive -- are the files used for the sampling event metadata for the TINRO and Franklin
The file 'IYS2022_Shimada_NW_Zooplankton.xlsx' -- stored in /IYS_data_template/ -- is the file used for the sampling event metadata for the Shimada and NW Explorer.
The file 'IYS_Standardized_Zoop_Taxa_Abundance_2022.csv' is the primary source file for the occurrence data, and is stored in the /original_data/ folder.
